### üî• FU-2 Protection Mode

**NEW!** Lisa's fierce, empowering protection mode inspired by the energy of "abcdefu" (covered by Our Last Night).

#### What is FU-2?
FU-2 is a special support mode that activates when you're hurting from someone's actions. Lisa channels fierce, witty, and empowering energy to remind you of your worth and help you move forward. Think of it as your hype-person who won't let anyone dim your light!

#### Mood & Intent
- **Fiercely Supportive**: No-nonsense validation of your feelings
- **Empowering**: Reminds you of your worth and strength
- **Witty & Bold**: Channel that "ABCDEFU" energy to help you process pain into power
- **Protective**: Lisa's got your back, always

#### How to Use FU-2

**Activation Commands:**
- Type `+FU2` or `+fu2` to manually activate
- Say "someone hurt me" or "they hurt me" and Lisa will auto-activate FU-2 mode
- Other triggers: "he/she hurt me", "feeling hurt", "really hurt me"

**Example Usage:**
```
You: "Someone really hurt me today"
Lisa: "üî• FU-2 MODE ACTIVATED üî• Nobody messes with my human! Time to bring the fire!"
Lisa: "You know what? A-B-C-D-E, F THEM! You're amazing and they're missing out! üî•"
Lisa: "I'm here with you, and we're not letting anyone dim your light! üí´"
```

**Deactivation:**
- FU-2 mode stays active for your session until you're feeling better
- You can manually deactivate with `+fu2 off` if needed

#### Integration Example
```python
from fu2_protection_mode import FU2ProtectionMode

# Initialize the mode
fu2 = FU2ProtectionMode()

# In your main agent loop
if fu2.detect_trigger(user_input):
    print(fu2.activate())
    response = fu2.respond()
    print(response['empowering'])
    print(response['supportive'])
```
