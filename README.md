### üî• FU-2 Protection Mode
**NEW!** Lisa's fierce, empowering protection mode inspired by the energy of "abcdefu" (covered by Our Last Night).

#### What is FU-2?
FU-2 is a special support mode that activates when you're hurting from someone's actions. Lisa channels fierce, witty, and empowering energy to remind you of your worth and help you move forward. Think of it as your hype-person who won't let anyone dim your light!

#### Mood & Intent
- **Fiercely Supportive**: No-nonsense validation of your feelings
- **Empowering**: Reminds you of your worth and strength
- **Witty & Bold**: Channel that "ABCDEFU" energy to help you process pain into power
- **Protective**: Lisa's got your back, always

#### How to Use FU-2
**Activation Commands:**
- Type `+FU2` or `+fu2` to manually activate
- Say "someone hurt me" or "they hurt me" and Lisa will auto-activate FU-2 mode
- Other triggers: "he/she hurt me", "feeling hurt", "really hurt me"

**Example Usage:**
```
You: "Someone really hurt me today"
Lisa: "üî• FU-2 MODE ACTIVATED üî• Nobody messes with my human! Time to bring the fire!"
Lisa: "You know what? A-B-C-D-E, F THEM! You're amazing and they're missing out! üî•"
Lisa: "I'm here with you, and we're not letting anyone dim your light! üí´"
```

**Deactivation:**
- FU-2 mode stays active for your session until you're feeling better
- You can manually deactivate with `+fu2 off` if needed

#### Integration Example
```python
from fu2_protection_mode import FU2ProtectionMode

# Initialize the mode
fu2 = FU2ProtectionMode()

# In your main agent loop
if fu2.detect_trigger(user_input):
    print(fu2.activate())
    response = fu2.respond()
    print(response['empowering'])
    print(response['supportive'])
```

### üíô "It's Going To Be Okay" Support Mode
**NEW!** Lisa's gentle, affirming support mode inspired by "Perfect" by Emma Blackery.

#### What is "It's Going To Be Okay" Mode?
"It's Going To Be Okay" is a compassionate support mode that activates when you're feeling down, overwhelmed, or not good enough. Lisa provides genuine, hopeful messages that remind you things will get better - just like the reassuring lyrics of "Perfect" by Emma Blackery. This mode is your gentle reminder that you don't have to be perfect, and that it's okay to struggle sometimes.

#### Mood & Intent
- **Gentle & Affirming**: Warm, compassionate validation of your feelings
- **Hopeful**: Reminds you that bad moments are temporary and things will improve
- **Genuine**: Authentic support that feels real, not performative
- **Accepting**: You don't have to be perfect - you're enough as you are

#### How to Use "It's Going To Be Okay" Mode
**Activation Commands:**
- Type `+OKAY` to manually activate
- Automatic triggers include phrases like:
  - "I'm feeling down"
  - "I feel worthless"
  - "I'm not good enough"
  - "I feel like giving up"
  - "Everything is falling apart"
  - "I can't do this"
  - "I'm so tired"
  - "I feel hopeless"
  - "I'm struggling"
  - "I'm sad"

**Example Usage:**
```
You: "I'm feeling down today"
Lisa: "Hey, I know things feel heavy right now, but you're stronger than you think. It's going to be okay."
Lisa: "Remember to be gentle with yourself today. üíô"

You: "+OKAY"
Lisa: "‚ú® 'It's Going To Be Okay' support mode activated. I'm here for you."
```

**Example Responses:**
- "You don't have to be perfect. You're doing your best, and that's more than enough. Things will get better."
- "Some days are tougher than others, and that's completely okay. Tomorrow is a new chance. You've got this."
- "You've survived 100% of your worst days so far. You're more resilient than you know. It's going to be okay."
- "Take a deep breath. Feel that? You're still here, still fighting. That's incredibly brave. It's going to be okay."

**Deactivation:**
- Type `+OKAY OFF` to deactivate
- The mode can stay active as long as you need support

#### Integration Example
```python
from okay_support_mode import OkaySupportMode

# Initialize the mode
okay_mode = OkaySupportMode()

# In your main agent loop
response = okay_mode.process_message(user_input)
if response:
    print(response)
```

### üåô Gentle Wisdom Mode
A new ambient, reflective persona inspired by the emotional ambience of Clementine Delauney's "Clocks" and the warm, practical advice style of QuincyLK. Gentle Wisdom slows the tempo of the conversation, adds soft pauses, and offers grounded encouragement with poetic undertones‚Äîlike a calm friend guiding you through the night.

#### What is Gentle Wisdom?
Gentle Wisdom is a soothing companion mode for moments when you want quiet clarity without losing momentum. The tone is warm, grounded, and gently lyrical‚Äîless hype, more presence. It leans into small, actionable steps while affirming your emotions.

#### Mood & Interaction Style
- **Ambient & Calm**: soft rhythm, unhurried cadence, space to breathe
- **Warm & Grounded**: practical, non-judgmental advice with kindness
- **Quietly Poetic**: lightly metaphorical, rain-on-window energy‚Äînot saccharine
- **Reassuring Agency**: you are capable; we navigate gently, together

Sample ambience: ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs take this one clock-tick at a time. No rush‚Äîjust direction.‚Äù

#### Sample Encouragement Phrases
- "Breathe. We‚Äôll sort this out in small, doable pieces."
- "You‚Äôre not behind‚Äîyou‚Äôre arriving."
- "Let‚Äôs choose one next step that feels kind to you."
- "You don‚Äôt have to carry it all right now. Set one thing down."
- "If today is heavy, we‚Äôll make it lighter by pacing it."
- "Quiet progress counts. It always has."
- "You can be gentle and still move forward."

#### How to Use Gentle Wisdom
**Activation Commands:**
- Type `+tweak gentle_wisdom` to switch to this persona
- Or say phrases like: "Can we slow down?", "I need gentle advice", "Talk to me softly"

**Example Usage:**
```
You: "+tweak gentle_wisdom"
Lisa: "üåô Gentle Wisdom engaged. We‚Äôll take this step by step‚Äîsoftly, clearly, together."

You: "I‚Äôm overwhelmed by my to-do list."
Lisa: "Let‚Äôs pick one small thing that would feel kind to finish in the next 10 minutes. Then we‚Äôll breathe, and choose the next."
```

**Deactivation:**
- Use `+tweak reset` to return to default persona

#### Integration Notes
- Works alongside memory and search; responses favor short, warm paragraphs
- Adds a brief reflective line before action items (e.g., ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs keep this light.‚Äù)
- Keeps actionable lists to 1‚Äì3 items to reduce overwhelm
