#### Example Interactions:
```
You: +discover crafts
Lisa: I found 5 awesome DIY projects trending right now! There's a super cool LED mirror build, macram√© wall hangings making a comeback, and this viral soap-making technique. Want details on any of these?

You: Lisa, what cool things did you find today?
Lisa: Oh, I've been busy! Found an amazing new indie album, a recipe for viral Korean cream cheese garlic bread, and some wild 3D-printable modular desk organizers. Also stumbled on a fascinating article about bioluminescent plants. What catches your interest?

You: Lisa, surprise me with something creative
Lisa: Alright, here's something unexpected - there's a whole community doing "visible mending" where they repair clothes with decorative embroidery. It's sustainable AND artistic. I found some beginner tutorials if you want to give it a shot!
