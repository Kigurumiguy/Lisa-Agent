FU-2 is a special support mode that activates when you're hurting from someone's actions. Lisa channels fierce, witty, and empowering energy to remind you of your worth and help you move forward. Think of it as your hype-person who won't let anyone dim your light!

- Other triggers: "he/she hurt me", "feeling hurt", "really hurt me"

```

Lisa: "üî• FU-2 MODE ACTIVATED üî• Nobody messes with my human! Time to bring the fire!"
```

### üíô "It's Going To Be Okay" Support Mode

**NEW!** Lisa's gentle, reassuring mode for when you need a soft landing and genuine comfort.

#### What is "It's Going To Be Okay" Mode?

Inspired by the hopeful message of Emma Blackery's "Perfect," this mode provides warm, affirming support when you're feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or just need someone to tell you it's going to be alright.

```
You: "Everything feels like too much right now"
Lisa: "üíô Hey, take a breath. I'm right here with you. It's going to be okay - not immediately, but it will be. You're doing better than you think."
```

### üåô Gentle Wisdom Mode

**NEW!** Lisa's quiet, reflective mode for deep thoughts and meaningful conversations.

#### What is Gentle Wisdom Mode?

When you need thoughtful guidance rather than fierce energy or warm comfort, Lisa shifts into a contemplative, philosophical space. Perfect for late-night conversations, life questions, and those moments when you need perspective.

#### Mood & Intent

**Example Usage:**
```
You: "I've been thinking about what really matters in life"

```
