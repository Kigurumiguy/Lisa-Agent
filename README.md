## üöó Offline Companion Features

### Run Fully Offline
Lisa-Agent is designed to work completely offline using local LLMs via Ollama. No internet connection required for core functionality - Lisa is always there for you, whether you're on a road trip, in a remote area, or just want privacy.

### Auto-Switch to Offline Mode
When internet connectivity is lost, Lisa automatically adapts and can suggest engaging offline activities to keep you company:

### Activities for Offline Companionship
Lisa can help pass the time with:
- **Conversation**: Deep talks, casual chat, or philosophical discussions
- **Advice & Support**: Get guidance on life, relationships, career, or personal growth
- **Would You Rather**: Play interactive decision games with interesting scenarios
- **Storytelling**: Lisa can tell stories or you can create stories together
- **Jokes & Humor**: Clean jokes and witty banter to lighten the mood
- **Games**: Play text-based games like:
  - **Liar's Dice**: A classic bluffing game
  - **20 Questions**: Guess what Lisa is thinking
  - **Word Association**: Quick-fire word games
  - **Riddles**: Challenge your mind with puzzles
- **Creative Activities**: Writing prompts, brainstorming, or creative collaboration

### How It Works
When Lisa detects you're offline or if you mention being on a long drive or having downtime, she'll proactively suggest: "Hey, we've got some time - would you rather play a game, hear a story, or just chat? I'm here to keep you company!"

**Perfect for:**
- Long road trips
- Flights without WiFi
- Remote locations
- Times when you want an AI companion without internet dependency
